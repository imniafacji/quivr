Why did Dumitru Almas write Povestiri Istorice Dumitru Almas 42.pdf? He wrote this book especially for young children who had not yet started studying history at school. He wanted to help them learn about their national heritage and to love their country. He said: "I confess: it was not an easy task. But I worked hard to write it out of a persistent inner command, called the zeal to help our little preschoolers and schoolchildren, our dear children, to begin to understand, from an early age, something of the truth of history and the light of the legends of the homeland. I liked to work hard writing it, thinking of making them feel, from the years when they barely open their eyes to the world, that they have grandparents and great-grandparents worthy of being loved and respected. That they have a homeland of their own, defended, enriched and beautified by these ancestors. That this homeland, Romania, has a history of work, creation, struggle and heroism that they are obliged to know and love, as they love themselves. That love of country must be like all the feelings with which they were born and in which they must grow: deep, serious, dignified, noble."[^2^]
